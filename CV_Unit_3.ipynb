        "   - VGG networks are significantly deeper than earlier architectures like AlexNet.\n",

        "- Stacking multiple 3x3 convolutional layers increases the effective receptive field without using larger filters (e.g., 5x5 or 7x7).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Max-Pooling Layers**:\n",
        "- After every block of convolutional layers, a **2x2 max-pooling layer** with a stride of 2 is applied to reduce the spatial dimensions by half.\n",

It is one of the most influential architectures in deep learning and computer vision. ResNet addressed a critical problem in training very deep neural networks: **vanishing gradients** and **degradation**, where adding more layers to a network leads to worse performance due to difficulty in optimization.\n",

        "\n",
        "**DenseNet**, or **Densely Connected Convolutional Networks**, was introduced by **Gao Huang et al.** in 2017 in the paper **\"Densely Connected Convolutional Networks\"**. DenseNet is a groundbreaking architecture that improves upon traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by introducing **dense connections** between layers. This design enables feature reuse, reduces the number of parameters, and improves gradient flow during training.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Dense Connectivity**:\n",
        "   - Each layer in DenseNet is connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion.\n",
        "   - Instead of passing only the output of the previous layer to the next layer (as in traditional CNNs), DenseNet concatenates the outputs of all preceding layers and passes them to the current layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Reuse**:\n",
        "   - By reusing features from earlier layers, DenseNet avoids redundant computations and reduces the risk of vanishing gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compact Architecture**:\n",
        "   - DenseNet has fewer parameters compared to other architectures like ResNet because it uses feature concatenation instead of summation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Improved Gradient Flow**:\n",
        "   - Dense connections allow gradients to flow directly from later layers to earlier layers, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **State-of-the-Art Performance**:\n",
